Taking inspiration from travel and nature, Fjord is a cleanly designed blog theme that can showcase beautiful and expansive photos. Fear not if photos are not your primary focus, it can easily adapt - removing the side bar image simply leaves a clean and pleasant dark background that contrasts your content pages.

## How to Use

For those unfamiliar with Stackbit here's how it works - This theme is built to work with Static Site Generators (Jekyll/Hugo/Gatsby/etc) and Headless CMS (Contentful, NetlifyCMS, Forestry, DatoCMS, etc), Stackbit supports a myriad of different options so you can use the tools you like or try new ones.
